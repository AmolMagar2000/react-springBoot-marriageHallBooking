                                We believe that even though we're so often communicating and socialising online, itâ€™s those offline weddings, social and corporate events and activities that are most important. So we are starting off by making it easier for people to organise offline weddings, social and corporate events and find venues, artists, decorators, entertainers etc. for the same. What we have created is a web-based venue and vendor discovery platform that links event-organisers with the best function venues and vendors across India.
